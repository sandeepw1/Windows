
1. Create a simple volume on any one of the 20GB hard disk. Assign drive letter as h:
Format it. Create a folder and a file in this drive.

2. Shrink the volume h: by 15 GB. Thus the H: will be of 5 GB. Then create another simple volume of 8 GB and assign drive letter as J:

3. Now extend h: to consume remaining free space (7GB).
