1. Configure a DHCP server to assign 100 addresses to the clients. Provide default gateway. The DNS server address will be your DC and ADC address.
Make sure the VMWare DHCP is off. 

Check if client is getting IP address.

2. Provide a reservation for the client to get 100 IP address of your network (e.g. if your network is 192.168.100 then client should get 192.168.100.100)
